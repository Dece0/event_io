# Event_io

This project is focused on creating **APIs for event management** (REST and GraphQL) in different programming languages like NodeJS, PHP, Python and their frameworks.

## Database

**Entity-relationship diagram** was created in [dbdiagram.io](https://www.dbdiagram.io) which is a online, free and simple tool to draw ER diagrams by just writing code. Whole ER diagram for Event_io with tables and their columns is located [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/630b1e2af1a9b01b0ff77c45).
